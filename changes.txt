in music.py:
-fixed the bug with pause and resume commands

-added 'curr_song' as an atribute

-divided 'get_source' into 2 functions, 'get_source' and 'get_audio'
where 'get_audio' returns an audio info using ytdl search, and 'get_source' takes in audio url and returns an opus formatted source

-if the audio queue is empty, instead of playing the audio directly, it is added to the queue
and 'play_next_song' method is called

-added 'formatting.py' for fomatting strings such as song names or messages

-implemented '!lyrics' command to request currently playing song's lyrics using the 'lyricsgenius' module
